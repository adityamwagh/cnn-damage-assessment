# Multi-Head Convolutional Networks for Post Earthquake Damage Assessment.

A convolutional neural network (CNN) written in Python using Keras and TensorFlow for post-earthquake assesment of damaged buildings. The model is trained on the synthetically generated [QuakeCity](https://sail.cive.uh.edu/quakecity/#:~:text=A%20dataset%20of%20annotated%20images,surveys%20of%20earthquake%20damaged%20buildings.) dataset.
